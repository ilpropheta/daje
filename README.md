# daje
I've been completely enraptured by HackerRank and similar websites. 

In this repository I'm collecting common code, particular data structures, interesting algorithms and so on. Maybe it can be useful to other programmers. It's mostly C++ code but I like to solve challenges in other languages as well. 

If you feel like connecting with me on HackerRank, here is my profile:

## Why "daje"?
Don't try to find any acronym for "daje". It's roman slang meaning something like "Yippee!". This repository is named "daje" merely for two reasons: on one hand I generally name github repository as roman words, on the other hand when I solve a challenge I exult by shouting out "daje!".
