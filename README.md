# daje
I've been completely enraptured by HackerRank and similar websites. 

In this repository I'm collecting common code, particular data structures, interesting algorithms and so on. Maybe it can be useful to other programmers. At the moment it's all C++ code, but I like solving challenges in other languages as well.

If you feel like connecting with me on HackerRank, here is my profile:

## This is NOT a library

Files in this repository are not intended to be included somewhere. They contain snippets, functions, data structures, easy to copy-and-paste into the challenge editor.

__However__ my convention here is the following:
* .h files can be used as header-only
* .hpp files are intended to be snippets or groups of common/similar code

## Why "daje"?
Don't try to find any acronym for "daje". It's roman slang meaning something like "Yippee!". This repository is named "daje" merely for two reasons: on one hand I generally name github repository as roman words, on the other hand when I solve a challenge I exult by shouting out "daje!".
