# daje
I'm used to practice programming on several websites like [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/ilpropheta).

From time to time, I use this repository to collect common code, data structures, interesting algorithms and so on. Maybe it can be useful to other people. At the moment it's all C++ code, but I like solving challenges in other languages as well.

## This is NOT a library

Files here are not really intended to be linked as a whole. They contain snippets, functions, data structures, easy to copy-and-paste into the challenge editor.

__However__ my convention here is the following:
* .h files can be used as header-only
* .hpp files are intended to be snippets or groups of common/similar code

## Why "daje"?
"daje" is a popular word in Rome and it comes with different meanings. One can be translated with "Yippee!"
This repository is named "daje" merely for two reasons: on one hand I like naming repositories with such Roman words and, on the other hand, "daje!" is what I shout when I solve a programming problem.
